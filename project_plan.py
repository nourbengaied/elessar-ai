# 4. LLM INTEGRATION STRATEGY
# =============================================================================

"""
LLM PROMPT ENGINEERING:

System Prompt:
"You are a financial assistant helping freelancers classify their bank transactions.
Your task is to determine if a transaction is a business expense or personal expense.
Consider the following factors:
- Business context (freelancing, consulting, etc.)
- Transaction description and merchant
- Amount and frequency
- Tax implications

Respond with:
1. Classification: 'business' or 'personal'
2. Confidence score: 0.0 to 1.0
3. Reasoning: Brief explanation of your decision
4. Suggested category: (e.g., 'office supplies', 'travel', 'meals', etc.)"

Example Transaction:
"Date: 2024-01-15, Description: AMAZON.COM, Amount: $45.67, Merchant: Amazon"

Expected Response:
{
    "classification": "business",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "Amazon purchase likely for office supplies or business equipment",
    "category": "office_supplies"
}
